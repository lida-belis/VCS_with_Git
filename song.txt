And there's a line on the horizon
You're like a lion and the lamb
Is it a tragedy or triumph?
You're so good, it's sick

Why did you swallow down my passion?
Now I'm your number one fan
Naked on a desert island, yeah
You're so good, it's sick

Now it feels like beautiful madness
Feels like never enough
Don't you know that you are the baddest?
My love, my love, my love
